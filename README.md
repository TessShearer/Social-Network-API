# Description
  As a social media site, Social Netwok API would like to have the back end capabilities to allow interactions and posts between users. I created the back end, which allows users to post thoughts, reactions to their own and each other's thoughts, and add friends. It also allows thoughts and users to be updated. Friends, thoughts, reactions, and users can all be deleted as well.
